# Trivia Game
Javascript trivia game using the opentdb.com api.

In this project I use AJAX and Javascript to construct a trivia game with a pre-built API. This game gives the user feedback on their answer and at the end gives a score. The API is from opentdb. It provides different categories and difficulty that I incorporate and give the user to the ability to choose.
